# Javascript Challenge
This is a fun project on fictional alien sightings
    (No, I do not belive in UFOs, but this is still a cool project)

# UFO-one
Use index.html to display findings
Use the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects => appends a table to the index page => then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
index.html uses date form and app.js can be rerun to renew data.
